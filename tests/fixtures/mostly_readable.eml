This email is mostly readable with valid UTF-8 content.
Here is some normal text that should decode fine.
But here are some bad bytes: ÿþ that don't decode.
Back to normal readable text again.
More readable content here to ensure we hit 90%+ readable ratio.
The parser should accept this despite the few corrupted bytes.
